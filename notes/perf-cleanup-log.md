# Perf + cleanup pass — progress log

Tracks an incremental cleanup/performance pass. **One item per commit.** Resuming a
session? Read this file first, find the next `todo`, do that one item, verify, update
the row, stop.

Full plan rationale lives in the approved plan file (Claude plan
`do-you-suggest-any-agile-kazoo`). Branch: `perf-cleanup`.

## Notes per item

### 1a — Debounce view setting write-backs
Three view components saved settings to disk on every local `$state` change. Swapped
`void plugin.saveSettings()` → `plugin.saveSettingsDebounced()` (existing 600ms
debouncer, `main.ts:51`) in the writeback `$effect` of:
- `src/components/side_views/TreeView.svelte`
- `src/components/side_views/Matrix.svelte`
- `src/components/page_views/TrailView.svelte` (also dropped the now-needless `untrack`
  wrapper — the debouncer reads nothing reactive)

No behavior change beyond coalescing rapid disk writes. Verify: `bun run build`.

### 1b — Index date_note period lookups
`add_period_edges` in `src/graph/builders/explicit/date_note.ts` did
`notes.find(n => n.basename === target_basename)` inside two nested loops
(daily→period and finer→coarser), i.e. O(n·m) string scans per rebuild. Built a
`basename → PeriodNote` Map per period kind once (alongside `period_notes`, keeping the
first occurrence to match prior `.find()` semantics) and replaced both `.find()` calls
with `.get()`. `period_notes` arrays kept for the sequential-next loop. Identical edges.

### 1c — Debounce opt-in layout-change rebuild
When `commands.rebuild_graph.trigger.layout_change` is enabled, the `layout-change`
handler in `src/main.ts` called `void this.rebuildGraph()` directly — a full rebuild on
every CM6 cursor move/scroll. Swapped to `this.rebuildGraphDebounced()` (existing 1500ms
`_rebuild_debouncer`), matching the `else` branch. Default for the trigger is `false`,
so only opt-in users were affected.

### 2a — Remove dead code
- Deleted `src/utils/markmap.ts` (only `export const Markmap = {}`, never imported — the
  `Markmap` used in CodeblockMarkmap.svelte comes from the `markmap-view` package).
- Removed commented-out `// import { Traverse }` in `src/api/index.ts`. Left the
  `TODO(RUST)` commented method stubs below it (tracked future work).
- Removed commented-out `EdgeToAdd` type + its doc comment in `src/interfaces/graph.ts`.
Zero refs confirmed by grep before deleting.

### 2b — Tighten `any` casts
- `src/external/dataview/index.ts`: replaced the two `(app as any).plugins...` accesses
  with a single `PluginRegistry` interface and `app as unknown as PluginRegistry`. Also
  switched bracket `["dataview"]` to dot notation (eslint). Dropped the two
  `no-explicit-any` eslint-disable comments.
- `src/main.ts` `getMetdataPropertyType`: replaced `(metadataTypeManager as any)` with a
  cast to `{ getAssignedWidget(field: string): string }`, dropping the three
  unsafe-call/any eslint-disable comments. Still guarded by the existing `in` check.

### 3 — Dedup validate_edge_field
New helper `src/graph/builders/explicit/validate_field.ts` exports `validate_edge_field`
(falsy→`fail(undefined)`, non-string→`invalid_field_value`, not-registered→
`invalid_edge_field`, else `succ(string)`). Replaced the copy-pasted 3-branch blocks in
9 sites across 7 builders: folder, dendron, johnny_decimal, tag (field + sibling),
list (field + neighbour), regex (field), traverse. Removed now-unused `fail`/
`graph_build_fail` imports where the block was their only use.

Behavior notes:
- Error **message** wording was unified to `<field> is not a valid field` (was a mix of
  "valid field" / "valid BC field"). Codes unchanged; tests assert only on `.code`.
- traverse_note: dropped a dead `raw || default_field` fallback (raw is already a truthy
  string at that point, so default was never reached). Identical behavior.

Verify: `bun run build`, `bunx eslint`, `bun run test tests/graph/builders/` (68 green).

### 4 — date_note builder tests
New `tests/graph/builders/date_note.test.ts` (9 tests). Covers `add_period_edges` (the
1b refactor): period sequential-next edges, finer→coarser `up` via the basename Map
(week→month, month→quarter), absent-target skip, and the daily→period path with the
**week_start** edge case — Sunday 2024-01-07 maps to 2024-W01 under `monday` vs 2024-W02
under `sunday`. Plus the invalid-`default_field` error and `edge_source` tag. Helper
deep-clones `DEFAULT_SETTINGS.explicit_edge_sources.date_note` so every period kind is
present, then applies per-kind overrides. Full suite: 221 green (was 212).

Remaining builders (4b) need extra mocks not in `helpers.ts` yet: folder_note wants a
`getAbstractFileByPath` returning a TFolder tree; dataview_note wants a stub Dataview
api; traverse_note wants `metadataCache.resolvedLinks`.
